                <p>Welcome to Sunset Coffee Shop, a dream that started with a single coffee bean. Founded in 2020 by a team of passionate coffee lovers, our journey began with a simple goal: to serve the highest quality coffee while creating a warm, inviting space for our community.</p>
                <p>What started as a simple love for coffee has grown into a passion for creating a warm and welcoming space where every cup tells a story. We believe coffee is more than just a drink—it’s an experience, a comfort, and a connection. From our signature mochas to our handcrafted classics, each beverage is made with care, quality ingredients, and a sprinkle of creativity.</p>
